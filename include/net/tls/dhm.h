 * Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.
 *
 * RFC-3526: More Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups for Internet
 * Key Exchange (IKE) defines a number of standardized Diffie-Hellman groups
 * for IKE.
 *
 * RFC-5114: Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use with IETF Standards
 * defines a number of standardized Diffie-Hellman groups that can be used.
 *
 * The security of the DHM key exchange relies on the proper choice of prime
 * modulus - optimally, it should be a safe prime. The usage of non-safe primes
 * both decreases the difficulty of the underlying discrete logarithm problem
 * and can lead to small subgroup attacks leaking private exponent bits when
 * invalid public keys are used and not detected. This is especially relevant
 * if the same DHM parameters are reused for multiple key exchanges as in static
 * DHM, while the criticality of small-subgroup attacks is lower for ephemeral
 * DHM.
 *
 * For performance reasons, the code does neither perform primality nor safe
 * primality tests, nor the expensive checks for invalid subgroups. Moreover,
 * even if these were performed, non-standardized primes cannot be trusted
 * because of the possibility of backdoors that can't be effectively checked
 * for.
 *
 * Diffie-Hellman-Merkle is therefore a security risk when not using
 * standardized primes generated using a trustworthy ("nothing up my sleeve")
 * method, such as the RFC 3526 / 7919 primes. In the TLS protocol, DH
 * parameters need to be negotiated, so using the default primes systematically
 * is not always an option. If possible, use Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
 * (ECDH), which has better performance, and for which the TLS protocol mandates
 * the use of standard parameters.
